Cars project for Kotlin + JavaFX

This is my simulator designed to teach Steering Behaviors in Math&Physics classes for games.

Students must change files inside ```cars.student``` package:

* [Setup.kts](./src/main/kotlin/cars/student/Setup.kt): Returns a list of cars that will be part of the simulation
* [StudentCar.kts](./src/main/kotlin/cars/student/StudentCar.kt): Template car. Does not move.
