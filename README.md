Cars project for Kotlin + JavaFX

This is my simulator designed to teach Steering Behaviors in Math&Physics classes for games.

Students must change files inside ```cars.student``` package:

* [Setup.kts](./src/main/kotlin/cars/student/Setup.kt): Returns a list of cars that will be part of the simulation
* [StudentCar.kts](./src/main/kotlin/cars/student/StudentCar.kt): Template car. Does not move.

The teacher branch contains all implemented behavior that will be presented in classes.
The setup car also has several demonstration scenarios.

This implementation meant to be didactical, not optimized.
